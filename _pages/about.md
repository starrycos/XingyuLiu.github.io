<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I work at [Momenta](https://www.momenta.cn/) as a Machine Learning Engineer now in Shanghai.

I am now working on Deep Learning Planning for Navigation on Autopilot(NOA) in urban cities. If you are seeking any form of internship, please feel free to email me. We are hiring interns!

I graduated from [Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, XJTU](http://www.aiar.xjtu.edu.cn/), Xi'an Jiaotong University(西安交通大学人机所), with a master's degree in 2024, supervised by [Le Wang (王乐)](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/lewang) 
and [SanPing Zhou (周三平)](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/spzhou). Before that, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Automation from Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2021.

I received the National Scholarship at Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2023.

My research interests lie in computer vision and reinforcement learning.

At Momenta, I worked on deep learning planning, data-driven simulation and e2e self-driving.

My ultimate goal is to make real-world impact through self-driving and embodied intelligence.
